# Personal Website

This repo contains the contents of my [personal website](https://davidkucher.com). Thanks for the helpful guides I listed below!

## Local Usage:
To run the flask app and modify the app in real time, run `python app.py`. To freeze it into static files for deployment, run `python app.py freeze`. And finally, to freeze it while also simulating a web server, run `python app.py serve` (note that this will be a static version of the first case, so no changes will be reflected)

## Notes:
Created 12/20, based on the [Flask tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/ "Flaskr Tutorial") using a free [HTML/CSS theme](https://www.themezy.com/free-website-templates/151-ceevee-free-responsive-website-template "Ceevee template"). With hosting help from this [Medium Guide](https://medium.com/swlh/create-and-host-your-personal-website-for-almost-nothing-pt-2-let-aws-do-the-work-583f2998d21a).
