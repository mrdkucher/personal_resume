Things I've learned:

- To center content: use a div with class="text-center"
- CSS elements can have a single id
- Nest CSS identifiers: e.g. ("#resume a:hover" will apply only to the element with id 'resume', with a child 'a' on the 'hover' action).
- Cmd + Shift + R is the hard refresh on Mac (gets CSS to update)
- Frozen Flask requires app routes to be configured with a trailing '/' to be read properly.
